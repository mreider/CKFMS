        brief: >
          Contains the span scoped raw values that were captured under the name `__attribute_name__` defined by the request attribute configuration.
          The values are mapped as an array according to the type of the captured attributes, so either boolean, double, long, or string.
          If the captured attributes have mixed types (e.g. long and string, or double and long, etc.), all attributes are converted to string and stored as string array.
        examples: [[42], ['Platinum'], [32, 16, 8], ['Special Offer', '1702'], ['18.35', '16']]
