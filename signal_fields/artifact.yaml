        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The identifier of the software artifact, typically the name of the artifact.
        examples: [ 'carts-service' ]
      - id: artifact.version
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The version of the software artifact, typically in [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) format.
        examples: [ '0.1.1' ]
      - id: artifact.name
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The human-readable name of the software artifact.
        examples: [ 'Carts service' ]
      - id: artifact.filename
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The filename of the software artifact, typically generated by the build process.
          This is similar to the `artifact.id`, but can contain the `artifact.version` and other data like file extension.
        examples: [ 'carts-service-amd64-0.1.1.tar.gz' ]
      - id: artifact.hash
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The full hash value of the software artifact.
          This value is used to verify the integrity of the software artifact.
        examples: [ '6c323d126547f71fafb4bffa02cdc480fb284678644ef0b6c69029f051fe5137' ]
      - id: artifact.purl
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) of the package artifact. This value is used to identify and locate the artifact.
        examples: [ 'pkg:npm/%40dynatrace/backstage@2.0.0', 'pkg:deb/debian/curl@7.50.3-1?arch=i386&distro=jessie' ]
      - id: artifact.attestation.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The ID of the build [software attestation](https://slsa.dev/attestation-model).
        examples: [ '1337' ]
      - id: artifact.attestation.filename
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The provenance filename of the built attestation. It directly relates to the `artifact.filename`.
        examples: [ 'carts-service-amd64-0.1.1.tar.gz.intoto.json1' ]
      - id: artifact.attestation.hash
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          The full hash value of the built attestation.
