    brief: >
      The time_correction namespace contains information on time corrections
      applied to the timestamps of an event, for example `start_time`, `timestamp`
      or `event.end`. Time corrections may be necessary if events are reported
      with timestamps that are completely off compared to cluster time, for
      example Dynatrace RUM reported data can be off depending on client time.
    attributes:
      - id: time_correction.offset
        type: long
        stability: experimental
        brief: The offset (in nanoseconds) that is applied to all timestamp fields. The value may be negative.
        examples: [ 127927969312 ]

      - id: time_correction.is_applied
        type: boolean
        stability: experimental
        brief: If set to `true`, time correction has been applied to the event's timestamps.
        examples: [ false ]
