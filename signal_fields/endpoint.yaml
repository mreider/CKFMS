          The endpoint name is derived from endpoint detection rules and uniquely identifies one endpoint of a particular service.
          Endpoint names are usually technology-specific and should be defined by attributes with low cardinality, like `http.route` or `rpc.method`.
          Endpoints are exclusively detected on request root spans.
        examples: [ 'GET /', 'PUT /users/:userID?', 'GET /productpage', 'Reviews.GetReviews' ]
