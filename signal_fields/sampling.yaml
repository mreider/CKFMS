          The sampling probability is encoded as `sampling.threshold` with respect to a 56-bit random integer `rv`.
          A span is sampled if `rv >= sampling.threshold`; the sampling threshold acts as a rejection threshold and can be interpreted as the number of spans discarded out of 2^56.
          The attribute is only available if the `sampling.threshold` is not `0`, and therefore sampling happened.
          The relationship between sampling probability and threshold is `sampling probability = (2^56-sampling.threshold) * 2^(-56)`.
          Hence, `sampling.threshold=0` means 100% sampling probability (collect all data), `sampling.threshold=2^55` corresponds to a sampling probability of 50%, `sampling.threshold=2^54` corresponds to a sampling probability of 75%.
