        brief: >
          Primary Grail tags are used to tag a resource in a meaningful way.
          `__key__` is populated with the tag name, for example, `primary_tags.ownership`.
          In case of single-value tags, the value is a string.
          In case of multi-value tags, the value is an array of strings.
        examples: [ 'team-alpha', 'team-bravo' ]
